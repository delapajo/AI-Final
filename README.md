# Abstract
Bank Marketing is a data set related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution based on telephone marketing. The data set provides a question of prediction if the client will subscribe a term deposit or not, using classification tools of machine learning. By comparing each model using the environment that was set up in PyCaret, it was evident that the model with the highest accuracy was Logistic Regression with an accuracy score of 0.9140. Assuming we are using the best model based on accuracy, Logistic Regression provides the highest results. However, It also provides one of the highest runtime out of all the other models provided with a score of 0.844 TT (Sec). For the purpose of this project, we're assuming that the runtime does not matter and so we use Logistic Regression as our best fit model. In any other case where other variables are taken into consideration, other models such as Linear Discriminant Analysis or Ridge Classifier would provide one of the highest accuracy while also having the lowest run time of 0.063 and 0.029 sec respectively. After tuning the best model, we end up with an accuracy metric of 0.9393 after the prediction on unseen data.
